# limegorilla documentation

Welcome! This is the docs site for all of the things I whack on the internet. This project - powered by
[nextra](https://nextra.site) is free to contribute to as well should you wish! See
[the contribution getting started](https://docs.limegorilla.co.uk/contribuiting) for more info.

<summary>Reading on GitHub?</summary>
This site gets rendered out to [https://docs.limegorilla.co.uk](https://docs.limegorilla.co.uk) and is - IMHO - a much better experience than navigating the [pages directory](https://github.com/limegorilla/docs/tree/main/pages) on GitHub.
