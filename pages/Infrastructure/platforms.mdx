# Platform & Tech Stack

Full overview of my mid-2023 tech stack. Opinionated as all heck.

## Authentication

Authentication for all services is handled by Clerk. In the rare occasion I need to literally just slap a login page on top of a page or service, Auth.JS is the perfect second choice.

See [Clerk's Docs](https://clerk.com/docs)

## Hosting

[Vercel](https://vercel.com) is the obvious choice for 99% of things I put online. Effectively free, and the platform also manages a number of other bits - including my Domain registration.

## Storage and Databases

## Web Frameworks
*Also incl: Front/Backend, API layer, middleware*

Most projects are best served by the [create-t3-app](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app) project, which happens to be what [quickstart](https://github.com/limegorilla/quickstart) project is - the t3 stack pre-setup with Tailwind, Clerk, the Next13 App Router and some other goodies.

### Styling

[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) is the only option here! It's an opinionated thing (as is any framework choice) but it's one that is standard now across everything I make.
